# comments are written python style

# lets implement our own println function based on top of ena.print function.
println {
  # the stack currently has our "Hello, world!" string and the "\n" string.
  "\n" # "\n" "Hello, world!"
  # since we need to append \n to our "Hello, world!", we need to swap them and concat them using concat_str word.
  swap # "Hello, world!" "\n"
  # concat_str takes the top word on the stack and appends the second string to the top word.
  # both arguments are dropped.
  concat_str # now the stack only contains "Hello, world!\n" string.
  print # now we just print it
}

# word "main" is the entry point of an ena program
main {
  "Hello, world!" println
  "it can be any string by the way" println
}
